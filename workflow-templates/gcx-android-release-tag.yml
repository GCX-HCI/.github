# This workflow builds the release variant of the project and uploads it to a newly created release 
# It is triggered by the creation of a tag named 'release/v*', e.g. 'release/v1.0.0'
# The <MY RELEASE NOTES> placeholder has to be replaced with the real release notes
# Please note that the KeyStore credentials have to be created as secrets in your project
# For more information about best practices, see:
